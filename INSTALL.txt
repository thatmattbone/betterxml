This will be available through PyPI at some point, we hope.

Installation is simple.

1. Make sure you have Python 2.6 or higher (2.5 probably works).

2. python setup.py build

3. python setup.py install

You don't actually need to install anything. If you want to use this stuff,
simply run the pythonpath.sh script in the unpacked directory and source it in
your current shell environment:

1. bash pythonpath.sh > set_python_path.sh

2. . ./set_python_path.sh
